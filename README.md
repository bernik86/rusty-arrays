# rusty-arrays

Rust library for array/matrix operations, including some basic IO and linear algebra.

Note that this library is in an early stages and many parts are not tested with regards to stability and performance (in fact, many implementations are rather brute force and not optimized for performance).

Note: currently, development mainly occurs in dev branch.
